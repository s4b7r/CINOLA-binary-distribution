# CINOLA – Classical Spin Dynamics and Monte Carlo Simulations Software (binary distribution)

This software was originally developed by Prof. Dr. Christian Schröder (Bielefeld Institute for Applied Materials Research BIfAM, Hochschule Bielefeld, University of Applied Sciences and Arts) as part of his dissertation. It is further extended by himself and members of his working group "Computational Materials Science and Engineering".

This is the compiled binary distribution for use within pyiron and other workflow environments.
