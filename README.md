# CINOLA – Classical Spin Dynamics and Monte Carlo Simulations Software (binary distribution)

This software was originally developed by Prof. Dr. Christian Schröder (Bielefeld Institute for Applied Materials Research BIfAM, Hochschule Bielefeld, University of Applied Sciences and Arts) as part of his dissertation. It is further extended by himself and members of his working group "Computational Materials Science and Engineering".

This is the compiled binary distribution for use within pyiron and other workflow environments.

## Target Platforms

Compiled binaries are provided to integrate CINOLA in workflows. We are happy to help, if there is not yet a binary for your platform: Ideally, just open an issue on GitHub. You can also send a mail to the repository owner.

| Platform    | File           |
|-------------|----------------|
| Windows x64 | CINOLA_x64.exe |
